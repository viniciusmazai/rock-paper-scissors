# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

## Project Overview

This project is a simple **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game developed in JavaScript. The game is designed to be played between a human player and the computer. The goal of the project is to reinforce core programming concepts such as conditionals, loops, and functions in JavaScript, as well as providing practice with user interaction through prompts and console output.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to build a fully functioning **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game that:
- Takes user input for their choice (rock, paper, or scissors)
- Generates a random choice for the computer
- Plays multiple rounds (best of 5) and keeps track of scores
- Declares the winner based on who won more rounds

## Features

- **User Input**: The player is prompted to enter "rock", "paper", or "scissors".
- **Computer Random Choice**: The computer randomly selects between "rock", "paper", and "scissors".
- **Score Tracking**: Scores are maintained for both the player and the computer.
- **Winner Announcement**: After five rounds, the game announces the overall winner or declares a tie.

## How It Works

1. The user will be prompted to input their choice: "rock", "paper", or "scissors".
2. The computer will make its selection randomly.
3. The program will compare the user's input with the computer's choice and determine the winner for that round.
4. After five rounds, the program will display the final score and declare the winner.

## Expected Result

At the end of the game:
- If the player wins more rounds, the program will display a message like **"You won the game!"**.
- If the computer wins more rounds, the message will be **"Computer won the game!"**.
- If both win the same number of rounds, the message will be **"It's a tie game!"**.

## How to Run the Game

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the HTML file in your preferred browser.
3. The game will be played via browser prompts and console logs. Ensure that your browser's console is open to track the scores and results.
